/**
 * The SpatialFlow full-player -> mini-player transition, ported from
 * MythicalSHUB/SpatialFlow's PlayerBottomSheetCompose: ONE artwork layer,
 * always mounted in the sheet root (outside both crossfade containers),
 * morphing continuously between the mini player's circular artwork slot and
 * the full player's artwork slot across the whole sheet travel.
 *
 * All morphing happens in the draw phase (graphicsLayer reads the sheet
 * progress and the two slot rects) — zero recomposition, zero layout
 * invalidation per frame. The pager's swipe gesture is only enabled near the
 * expanded end, exactly like the original, so the mini player keeps its own
 * horizontal swipe-to-dismiss behaviour.
 *
 * Slot rects are measured in root layout coordinates via onGloballyPositioned;
 * the sheet's graphicsLayer slide does not affect layout positions, and since
 * every participant (mini slot, full slot, this layer) lives inside the same
 * sliding sheet box, the shared offset cancels out.
 *
 * Overlay choreography (matching the original's PlayerBottomSheetCompose):
 * while the lyrics overlay is open its own flying artwork owns the morph, and
 * while the queue drawer is expanded the drawer owns the whole screen — the
 * shared layer fades to 0 (animated with the same spring family as the
 * drawer's slide / the flying artwork's morph, so the handoff is a crossfade
 * between two identical images rather than an instant pop) instead of
 * floating above them. `artworkActive` covers the canvas/video case: when the
 * player's artwork slot is occupied by a canvas or music video, the layer
 * never draws over the media surface (the mini player renders its own
 * thumbnail then).
